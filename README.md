# REMO-BAND
My team and I competed in the Ryerson Design League's Designation. We participated in the Biomedical case, where our team was tasked with creating an assistive device that addresses the symptoms of patients with Parkinson’s disease. We placed first place! 

**Design**

The black box in the front of this device will be a smartwatch where the main processor chip is embedded. On top of it, there will be a sensitive touchscreen that is user-friendly and does not require much physical force to interact with. This watch will have the same functions like any other smartwatches. Several peripheral devices include accelerometers to record the users’ movements and estimate the stages of tremors. The watch will support wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Wifi. Therefore, these measured data can be sent to the doctors which can help doctors give the exact treatment plan of the patient daily and remotely.  Users can also use health-related applications such as exercise monitors, heart rate monitors etc. 
Next to the watch, there are two gray flat magnets that can attach various weights to reduce the shaking. Depending on how serious users’ tremors are, the weight can be adjusted to optimize the control but usually, the weight is between 0.2 lbs and 0.5lb. Last but not least, the blue part is just a wrist band that is made of silicone rubber and can be customized to be fitted to users’.
